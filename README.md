Installing the ESP-Mail-Client Library.
Create a new email account for sending emails with the ESP32.
An app password can only be used with accounts that have 2-step verification turned on.
After enabling 2-step verification, you can create an app password.
If you’re using another email provider, check how to create an app password. You should be able to find the instructions with a quick google search “your_email_provider + create app password”.
